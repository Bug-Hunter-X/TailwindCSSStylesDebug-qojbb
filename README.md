# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying Correctly

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles are not applying correctly to elements, even though the configuration and imports appear to be set up properly.

## Bug Description

Styles defined in the `tailwind.config.js` file are not being applied to elements in the application.  This occurs even after ensuring that the Tailwind directives are correctly added to the CSS file and that the CSS file is correctly imported into the main Javascript file. Some styles are completely missing, while others are incorrect.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe that some Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly to the elements in the `index.html` file.

## Solution

The solution is provided in the `bugSolution.js` file. The issue was related to an incorrect import order in the `app.js` file. By moving the import of the CSS file above the import of other scripts, the problem was solved. This ensures that Tailwind's styles are loaded before any other elements in the application attempt to use them.
