I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I checked my configuration, and the classes were correctly defined in my `tailwind.config.js` file. My CSS file was being correctly imported into my main app.js file. Despite this, some styles were missing or incorrect.
